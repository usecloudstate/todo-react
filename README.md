# todo-react

Sample todo app built with the React/ReactDOM framework and [Cloud State](https://usecloudstate.io). [Live demo](https://practical-heisenberg-1dd358.netlify.app/).

Cloud State provides drop in authentication, state management and data query capabilities for React applications with a managed backend. [This commit diff](https://github.com/usecloudstate/todo-react/commit/ec4e79533fe17fd10bd788a539d401fda4c18ec7) shows you the exact changes that were made to the original codebase to integrate Cloud State.

For more information on Cloud State, see the [Cloud State documentation](https://docs.usecloudstate.io/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
